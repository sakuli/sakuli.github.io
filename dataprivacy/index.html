                    <h5>The following applies to registered users</h5>
                    <p>The Sakuli website offers visitors various options to register for promotional and information e-mails, online webinars, and resources as well as support with the evaluation of our software and services. These registration forms enable visitors to sign up for ConSol mailing lists, and require the entry of contact information (such as name and e-mail address). We use this contact information for the purpose of mailing out the requested information about our company, our products, or our services. During the registration process, users can select whether they agree to the terms of use or not. Users who have registered and subsequently wish to withdraw their registration can cancel future e-mails at any time (see section ‘Unsubscribing‘ below).</p>
                    
                    
                
                    
                    <p>As is customary in the industry, ConSol utilizes pixel tags and other methods to collect information about e-mails that the company mails out to registered website users as well as about the recipients of e-mails that registered users send to other persons. Pixel tags are tiny graphics files contained in HTML-encoded e-mails. When such an e-mail is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient’s computer accesses the ConSol servers to locate the pixel tag file. This allows ConSol to record and store information, such as e-mail addresses, the date and time when the recipient opened the e-mail, the HTML capability of the recipient’s e-mail program, and other protocol information. ConSol uses this information to optimize the delivery of future e-mails. </p>
                    
                    
                
                    
                    <p>Our service provider CleverReach GmbH &amp; Co. KG uses exclusively contents or e-mail address lists provided by ConSol for the creation or delivery of communications requested by ConSol.</p>
                    
                    
                
                    <h5>Unsubscribing and Updating Information</h5>
                    <p>If a user no longer wishes to receive the ConSol Newsletter, mailings, and promotional information, it is possible to unsubscribe by simply following the instructions contained in each Newsletter. If personal data changes or an e-mail recipient no longer wishes to receive specific mailings, all information or specific data can be corrected, updated, or deleted by entering the relevant changes on our website.</p>
                    
                    
                
                    <h5>Security and Data Protection</h5>
                    <p>ConSol and its service providers take all precautionary measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the information of website visitors and customers by means of industry-specific security measures, such as firewalls, in combination with carefully developed security procedures. These measures serve to protect visitor and customer information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized changes.</p>
