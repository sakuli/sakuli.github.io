      <description>This guide assumes, that you finished the getting started guide or you are experienced with Sakuli v1.
 The most of the complexity and conventions comes due to the backwards compatibility to V1 which requires such a folder and file layout for various reasons (the biggest is Sahi). Sakuli now offers various ways to reduce this complexity dramatically. This features will come eventually in upcoming releases.
 Setup and configuration The minimum setup of a Sakuli project looks like this:</description>

      <description>Prerequisites Sakuli is built and tested against the current LTS version of Node.js. So in order to run Sakuli on your system, we will assume that you have a node v10.15.3 (lts/dubnium) installed on your system.
To install Node.js on your system, you can either go to the node website, or you could use tools like node version manager, a utility to manage various node versions on a per-user basis.</description>

      <description>In addition to screenshot based test-actions, Sakuli is able to utilize your keyboard, clipboard and environment variables. All these features are incorporated in the Environment class.
Keyboard actions The following snippet shows a possible use-case for native keyboard actions. When initiating the download in FireFox, a native file download dialog opens. To start the download, we need to accept the file dialog, which is not possible with the capabilities of Selenium.</description>

      <description>Aside from the correct behavior of your system, you may also be interested in the actual performance of user interactions with the system.
First to Know, First to Act Identifying possible performance bottlenecks - before your users will - is a critical task for operators and administrators. Sakuli makes it possible to integrate such real-world performance analysis in an automated way. To achieve this, Sakuli provides a generic forwarder interface which receives the latest results of a test run.</description>

      <description>End-2-End Application Testing and Monitoring: Your Perfect Combination Combining end-2-end testing with monitoring solutions proves to be optimal – because effective quality assurance looks over and beyond any given server: Automated end-2-end tests ensure that your web or rich client ecosystem will keep its promise. Ultimately though, the quality of your systems will be assessed by the users.
Monitor Critical Workflows Imagine testing your critical processes and workflows by simulating a real-world user, sending execution times, warnings and error messages (including screenshots of the system under test) to the monitoring system of your choice.</description>

      <description>Sakuli Container in a Nutshell Our pre-configured Docker container will run Sakuli in an isolated environment. This will ensure having the same setup and equal conditions for every test-run. You don´t need an unlocked display for native UI interaction with the headless VNC image configured in every container. For debugging purposes, you will be able to watch your test execution live in a browser or a VNC client any time.</description>

      <description>Over the years systems and processes are growing, eventually heading for potential technology and media breakdowns. In such scenarios, automation of processes and daily tasks may become quite difficult. Sakuli can help to automate tasks between various system boundaries. Downloading a report from a browser-based reporting tool app and upload it to shared folder won’t create problems anymore: Sakuli closes the gap between browser automation and desktop automation.
Have Sakuli do the Work Add import or export functionalities to your application when APIs are missing or too expensive to implement.</description>

      <description>All You Need UI Test Automation Sakuli combines web testing with testing on native applications. That’s all you need in order to perfectly simulate a real-world user. Design your tests, have them run automatically and save a ton of time by dramatically reducing your manual testing.
Build Sustainable Tests Sakuli uses state of the art web-testing technologies like Selenium, wraps a lot of standard functionality and use-cases into user-friendly packages, thereby solving most of the pain points encountered by test designers in the past.</description>

      <description>A lot of end-to-end scenarios exceed the borders of your browser and the capabilities of webdriver. This might include common use cases like a drag and drop from the host system to a webpage or exporting a report into a spreadsheet or pdf-format. In these cases, your webbased tests can be extended to also validate behavior and invoke interactions outside the browser, all within a single test.
Of course, you can also use Sakuli’s native testing power on its own, e.</description>

      <description>Sakuli makes it easy to write tests that act like real-world users. It automatically sets up and starts a webdriver instance and also lets you take control over the systems’s mouse and keyboard. The example below shows a basic login to an imaginary webbased service with login form: (async () =&amp;gt; { const testCase = new TestCase(); try { await _navigateTo(&amp;#34;example.com&amp;#34;); await _setValue(_input(&amp;#39;user&amp;#39;), &amp;#39;me&amp;#39;); await _setValue(_password_(&amp;#39;password&amp;#39;), &amp;#39;top-$ecret&amp;#39;); await _click(_button(&amp;#39;Login&amp;#39;)); testCase.</description>
