These registration forms enable visitors to sign up for ConSol mailing lists, and require the entry of contact information (such as name and e-mail address). We use this contact information for the purpose of mailing out the requested information about our company, our products, or our services.

    content : "As is customary in the industry, ConSol utilizes pixel tags and other methods to collect information about e-mails that the company mails out to registered website users as well as about the recipients of e-mails that registered users send to other persons. Pixel tags are tiny graphics files contained in HTML-encoded e-mails. When such an e-mail is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient’s computer accesses the ConSol servers to locate the pixel tag file. This allows ConSol to record and store information, such as e-mail addresses, the date and time when the recipient opened the e-mail, the HTML capability of the recipient’s e-mail program, and other protocol information. ConSol uses this information to optimize the delivery of future e-mails. "
