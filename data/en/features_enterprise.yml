        title : Monitoring Forwarder
        content:
            - paragraph : "Combining End-2-End testing with monitoring solutions proves to be optimal – because effective quality assurance looks over and beyond any given server: Automated End-2-End tests ensure that your web or rich client ecosystem will keep its promise. Ultimately though, the quality of your systems will be assessed by the users."

            - paragraph : Test results and data of Sakulis open API can be forwarded to different target systems like Prometheus, OMD, checkmk, databases and propriertary systems.
            - heading : Monitor Critical Workflows
            - paragraph : Imagine testing your critical processes and workflows by simulating a real-world user, sending execution times, warnings and error messages (including screenshots of the system under test) to the monitoring system of your choice. Before the first customer complains about the performance, you will have been notified automatically and you will be able to investigate and minimize affects on your revenue stream.
            - paragraph : Sakuli and Sakuli Forwarder are designed to handle this task so you (and your manager) will finally find a good night’s sleep again.

        content:
            - heading : Sakuli Container in a Nutshell
            - paragraph : Our pre-configured Docker container will run Sakuli in an isolated environment. This will ensure having the same setup and equal conditions for every test run. You don’t need an unlocked display for native UI interactions with the headless VNC image configured in every container. For debugging purposes, you will be able to watch your test execution live in a browser or a VNC client any time. Scale your tests horizontally by instantiating as many containers as you need.
